### Content

The elevator pitch is one of the most important parts of a project. When you work hard all year to create something, it is an important skill to break it down and share the significance and purpose in only a minute. My expo elevator pitch went well because I practiced it a lot and was very experienced after doing it for 3 previous years. I also think that bringing in the physical Arduino part of my project combined with running the Android emulator on my computer led to success because I didn’t have to rely on a [video](https://youtu.be/c_uaEdzhNlE) to demo, and it made things more impressive. I also let the judges interact with the project by sending messages and playing games, which helped connect them to what I made. Looking back, I should have managed my time better because I didn’t get to explain everything that I wanted to. But in the end, it was a success because I became a finalist for the fourth year in a row.

The in-class presentation went well because I prepared for it in my [notes](https://github.com/samuels0052/apcsa-freedom-project/blob/main/prep/presentation.md) and am a confident public speaker. After presenting multiple times throughout high school, including in front of over 100 people at a debate conference, 18 of my peers is not intimidating at all. I felt good about my presentation and [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NvKfbjbegQxHPSF7gVXYaNkw4w_OytcttlRKSrd3VfQ/edit?usp=sharing) because I like to mix in some jokes into the content, which creates a more entertaining presentation. One of my takeaways is to use GIFs in my demo instead of skipping around a video. Another takeaway is to better manage my time in the future because I didn’t properly practice with time, so I almost didn’t finish in time.

### EDP

I am currently on stage **8** of the engineering design process. I have already finished my project and have given several presentations communicating what I have made and what my work process was. I have presented my project in class, during the expo, and I will present at the showcase because I am a four-time finalist.

### Skills

One of the skills I have grown in is **communication**. Communication is a very important skill because you can have the best project, but if you have a bad elevator pitch, it’s hard to become a finalist. I have been working on my presentation skills over the past 3 years, aided by Model UN, which has contributed to my success. Another skill I have grown in is a **growth mindset**. Although my slides and in-class presentation went well, I am still embracing a growth mindset to take the feedback I received to make my showcase slides even better. Part of this includes taking Mr. Mueller's advice to use GIFs to demo different components of my project instead of skipping around in a [video](https://youtu.be/c_uaEdzhNlE).
