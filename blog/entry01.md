### EDP
I am currently in stages 1 to 3 of the engineering design process. I have defined my issue and have begun researching and brainstorming possible solutions. One of my problems is elderly people not being able to stimulate their brains as much when they are all alone. To combat this, I plan to incorporate brain-stimulating games in my app to fix this issue. I also plan to add social networking features to prevent people from feeling so isolated. I also brainstormed a solution to hearing accessibility by starting to plan and develop smart glasses to assist with providing live captions during discussions. Although I am still researching and planning this, I do have a partially working prototype.

### Skills
One of the skills I have grown in is **how to learn**. When learning Arduino circuits, I had a challenging time understanding what each pin on the board did and how to connect it to a breadboard. I initially wasn't even able to get my display to output anything, and I wasn't sure if it was me or a bad part. However, after googling different diagrams and following along to the instructions of the display, I was able to get a working device. I learned that I had to get better at finding the proper documentation I needed and rely less on videos and more on circuit diagrams. Reading circuit diagrams was challenging at first, but as I kept reading more and more, I got better at understanding which wire goes where and connects to which pin on the Arduino. Another skill I have grown in is **embracing failure**. Learning Arduino is hard, especially in the beginning. I had to accept that there were going to be many things I did not understand, and I would need time to practice. Thankfully, I started my learning during the summer, which gave me more time. I also had to embrace failure when it came to React Native. I was not able to get anything to compile for days until I realized it was because of my npm version. I just had to accept this and then move on. I have learned how to let go of these small setbacks so I can continue with the rest of my project.
