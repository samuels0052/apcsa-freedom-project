# Presentation Plan

## Hook

How would you feel if after working your whole life, you were left alone in a nursing home to be forgotten? No family to visit or people to talk to or stimulate your mind. That's why I'm introducing Tirgum Lens a mobile app that connects you to a global community with mobile games to help stimulate your mind. And that's not it! You are also able to use the app to control an Arduino device to assist you with day to day functions.

## Product
* mobile app that connects with an arduino
* react native with expo framework, Arduino, firebase, express JS

## Process
* app > web server > arduino
* Explain that need to use a web server to communicate between my app and arduino since emulator can't read serial ports

## Conclusion
* Let's help connect the older members of our society one person at a time to ensure that no one is left behind. It's time to be the change in the world that we want to see.

<!-- EXAMPLE

## Hook
* Verbal riddle of GGD

## Product
* GIF/Demo of example/non-example

## Process
* Flowchart of plan
  * MVP: noun -> door -> yes/no
  * Beyond MVP: noun -> word relation API -> noun API -> yes/no, with counterexample
* Code snippets of:
  * MVP
  * Both APIs
  * Challenge with API keys

## Conclusion
* [URL to project]
* Takeaways
  * Less = more: the heart of the riddle was one line of code; it obviously took more to make the entire thing work, but one complicated line of regular expressions was essentially the solution to the riddle
  * Expect the unexpected: it’s important to budget time for things you don’t account for; for example, I didn’t consider the fact that I would need another entire API to detect nouns
  * Determination is key: ironically enough, I had to make my API keys private. At first, it didn’t seem like it was possible, which meant I couldn’t publish my app. But after all of that hard work, I was determined to find a solution, and I found it in config variables.
* "Presentation can’t, but a speech can"
